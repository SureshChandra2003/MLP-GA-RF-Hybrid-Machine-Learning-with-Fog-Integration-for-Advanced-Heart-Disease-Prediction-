# MLP-GA-RF-Hybrid-Machine-Learning-with-Fog-Integration-for-Advanced-Heart-Disease-Prediction-
ðŸ”¹ 1. Problem Statement:
"Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally. Early and accurate prediction is critical to reduce mortality. Traditional models often suffer from limited accuracy and scalability."

ðŸ”¹ 2. Proposed Solution (in simple terms):
"We developed a hybrid machine learning model called MLP-GA-RF that integrates a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Random Forest (RF), and deployed it using fog computing for real-time prediction."

ðŸ”¹ 3. Components Explained:
â–ª MLP (Multilayer Perceptron):
Acts as the core model to learn patterns from heart disease data.

â–ª GA (Genetic Algorithm):
Used to optimize MLP's weights and biases. It selects the best-performing parameter combinations using evolutionary strategies (selection, crossover, mutation).

â–ª RF (Random Forest):
Takes MLP-GA output and enhances prediction stability by handling non-linearities and reducing overfitting.

â–ª Fog Computing:
Improves real-time diagnosis by processing data closer to the source (like hospitals or wearable devices) instead of relying on cloud servers. This reduces latency.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Dataset Used:
"We used the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset with 303 records and 14 features including age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc."

ðŸ”¹ 5. Preprocessing:
Handled missing values

Categorical encoding

Feature scaling and selection using wrapper methods

Split into train/test sets

ðŸ”¹ 6. Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: 95.08%

Precision: 96.29%

Recall: 92.86%

F1 Score: 94.55%

AUC: 94.91%

"Our model outperformed other traditional classifiers like SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, and XGBoost."

ðŸ”¹ 7. Key Achievements:
High accuracy and generalization

Reduced false negatives (critical in healthcare)

Real-time deployment potential with fog integration

ðŸ”¹ 8. Summary Line:
"By combining neural networks, evolutionary optimization, ensemble learning, and edge computing, we built a highly accurate and scalable system for heart disease prediction suitable for real-time healthcare applications."
